# TQC
Source codes for implementation of the Kitaev Honeycomb model!

## Codes Description

* show.py
    * a utility script to show .log file generated by netket, either gui or cui
    * see more usages with `./show.log --help`
* honeycomb.py
    * some utility functions which will be used in many other codes. It includes, get_graph_reza(), get_hamiltonian(), exact_diag(), gs_energy_babak(), rbm()
    * you need to create machine yourself and pass it to rbm() to train it
    * This script is supposed to only be imported and used in other scripts
* exact_diag_for_reza.py
    * a script to show Reza that the exact diagonalize energy is different from Babak's formula
* test_flip_and_measure.py
    * test measure and flip technology by Ising model
    * measurment has been solved. Encountered some problems in flipping.
* play_with_alpha.py
    * try how large of alpha is suitable, by a 5x5 lattice, 1kx10k trains and alpha 0.1,0.3,0.5,1,1.5,2,3,4,6,8,10.
* try_other_machines.py
    * try ffnn and compare it with rbm, from the perspective of time, effecient of parameters and, the most important, accuracy.
