## Tomography

A typical tomography result is like tomo.png(in this dir). It is a tomography for 2x2 lattice. 
The parameters are: num_train_data=8x32x2000, alpha=2. 
The training datas are randomly generated by a groundstate. 
    
There are many intricate parameters in training to change, such as learning rate, train_batch_num, sample_num, num_train_data. 
Only with suitable parameters can satisfactory output be got. But these are tricky and not important.

## Plaquette Operator

I realized flipping spins by modifying parameters of RBM before. Now we can verify this by flipping a spin and observe corresponding plaquette operators change or not.

For a rbm for 2x2 lattice with alpha=2 got by tomography, its four plaquette operators are computed,
    
    A: 0.85984304
    C: 0.85363150
    B: 0.86507473
    D: 0.85877449

Then its 5th electron is flipped in yz direction, which will affect plaquette B and D. And its plaquette operators change to:
    
    A: 0.85984304
    C: 0.85363150
    B: -0.86507473
    D: -0.85877449

Then its 7th electron is flipped(based on last step), which will affect plaquette A and D:

    A: -0.85984304
    C: 0.85363150
    B: -0.86507473
    D: 0.85877449
    
Then its 3rd electron is flipped, which will affect plaquette A and B (i.e. back to initial state):

    A: 0.85984304
    C: 0.85363150
    B: 0.86507473
    D: 0.85877449
