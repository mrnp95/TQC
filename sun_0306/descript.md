## Tomography

A typical tomography result is like

(http://github.com/mrnp95/TQC/raw/master/sun_0306/2x2_a2.png)

It is a tomography for 2x2 lattice. 
The parameters are: num_train_data=8x32x2000, alpha=2. 
The training datas are randomly generated by a groundstate. 
    
There are many intricate parameters in training to change, such as learning rate, train_batch_num, sample_num, num_train_data. 
Only with suitable parameters can satisfactory output be got.
The number of training datas will affect the final pricision tomography can reach.
For example, the overlap can only reach 50% for 2x2 lattice when num_train_data=2000.

There is another interesting thing, which is, that only train_batch_num and sample_num both reach some thresholds can the tomography success. Or its overlap will fluctuates around a very low level forever. I call this phenomenon "launch". For example, for 2x2 lattice, when train_batch_num=sample_num=1k or larger can it "launch". But when train_batch_num=sample_num=500, it cannot. 


## Plaquette Operator

I realized flipping spins by modifying parameters of RBM before. Now we can verify this by flipping a spin and observe corresponding plaquette operators change or not.

For a rbm for 2x2 lattice with alpha=2 got by tomography, its four plaquette operators are computed,
    
    A: 0.85984304
    B: 0.86507473
    C: 0.85363150
    D: 0.85877449

Then its 5th electron is flipped in yz direction, which will affect plaquette B and D. And its plaquette operators change to:
    
    A: 0.85984304
    B: -0.86507473
    C: 0.85363150
    D: -0.85877449

Then its 7th electron is flipped (based on last step), which will affect plaquette A and D:

    A: -0.85984304
    B: -0.86507473
    C: 0.85363150
    D: 0.85877449
    
Then its 3rd electron is flipped, which will affect plaquette A and B (i.e. back to initial state):

    A: 0.85984304
    B: 0.86507473
    C: 0.85363150
    D: 0.85877449
    
In other words, the flipping I realizing before works perfectly.
